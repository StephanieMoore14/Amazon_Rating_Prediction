# Amazon_Rating_Prediction

For this project, we used a dataset of amazon reviews to look at unigrams and bigrams. The dataset is in JSON format and has information on the number of votes, review ID, user ID, review text, rating, genre ID, and genre. For this assignment we want to find the TF-IDF of the reviews and use it to predict the rating.
